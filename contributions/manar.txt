1.	Search for dataset:
•	First make a search at Ensemble where there is no fastq files, but there are fasta files for chromosomes as reference 
and their variation files
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-96/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-96/variation/gvf/homo_sapiens/
human genome resource and its vcf files:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/
•	Direct to SRA where datasets are very large then return back to Ensemble to find which chromosome is small in size 
and search for a dataset according to this chromosome in SRA 
•	Finding that chromosome 21&22 are the smallest
•	Direct to SRA and search for dataset related to chromosome 21 considering its size due to computational power.
•	Dataset for Trisomy 21 "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX4941314[accn]"   
•	Trying to download it using this resource: "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK158899/#SRA_download.accessing_the__ascp_utility"

"wget -c ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByRun/sra/SRR/SRR811/SRR8115017/SRR8115017.sra"

2. This dataset is selected according to:
•	Its size as mentioned before: 56.7M
•	Its platform: Illumina which is compatible with GATK
•	Number of reads: 202721 reads
•	Layout: single end to be different than other dataset
•	Organism: Homosapiens to be compatible with GATK
•	Source: Genomics


3.	Work on VCF statistics and filtration through these links:
• https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/sites/default/files/V04_FiltrageVariantNLapaluRoscoff2016_0.pdf
• https://genome.sph.umich.edu/w/images/b/b4/Variant_Calling_and_Filtering_for_INDELs.pdf
• https://genome.sph.umich.edu/w/images/e/e6/Seqshop_may_2015_day2_snp_lecture_v2.pdf

4.	Work on R script to get figures before and after base recalibration for SNP and Indels
We supposed that we will move on pipeline of this dataset and reach to VCF statistics
but unfortunately we couldn't because the number of annotated variants equal to zero 
So the document of figures "supposed results before filtration" got out R script using test data 
( wget https://de.cyverse.org/dl/d/3CE425D7-ECDE-46B8-AB7F-FAF07048AD42/samples.tar.gz ) that supposed to be replaced by our data.
